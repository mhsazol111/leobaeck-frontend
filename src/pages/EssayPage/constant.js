		'It was called the Simson Schwalbe (meaning “swallow,” as in the bird), and it came with a 3.4 hp, 50cc two-stroke engine, a three-speed transmission, and an ear-splittingly basic exhaust system. The original KR1 model was available in blue, “tundra gray,” and, in limited quantities, safety orange. Maximum speed: 60 km/h.',
		'Like other brands made ubiquitous by the dictates of a planned economy (from the Trabant sedan to Halberstädter sausages), the Schwalbe endeared itself to East German consumers not for its elegant design, quality, or reliability, but because it was one of very few choices for two-wheeled freedom on the market. Although they are no longer manufactured, repairs are simple, and used Schwalbe scooters are still hotly desired by a cult following of GDR nostalgists and grease-stained tinkerers.',
		'In this case, the fame of the model unjustly overshadows the fascinating Jewish history of the make. The trajectory of the Simson company is a prototypical story of Germany’s late but spectacular entry into the industrial revolution as well as the emergence of the vaunted “Mittelstand” of mid-sized manufacturing companies. It is also a case study in how the extension of civil rights to Jews in the 18th and 19th century transformed their economic prospects.',

		'In 1856, the Jewish brothers Moses and Löb Simson purchased a steel forge in Suhl, Thuringia (a traditional center of arms manufacturing), and began fulfilling contracts for gun barrels. By the time Moses’s grandsons Arthur and Julius took over the company in the early 1920’s, they oversaw thousands of workers producing firearms, bicycles, automobiles, and even aircraft engines.',
		'Moses and Löb Simson belonged to the first generation of Prussian Jews who were allowed to own real property. Like most Jews in 18th-century Prussia, their ancestors had been involved in commerce. Their grandfather was a hired hand for a Jewish cattle trader. Their father achieved an unusual level of success trading in linens and lending money, and he left his sons a modest inheritance of nearly 12,000 Reichstaler.',

		'Jews of Moses and Löb’s father’s generation in Prussia were barred from participating in agriculture or the trades, so they played mediating roles in the economy that even their staunchest defenders saw as degraded. In his 1781 treatise, On the Civic Improvement of the Jews, the historian and Jewish-rights advocate Christian Wilhelm von Dohm blamed the Jews’ bad reputation on the types of work that their limited rights forced them to take. He called for their “productivization” by way of integrating them into the “natural economy.” Leading voices of the Jewish Enlightenment, or Haskalah, echoed his call and linked their demands for freedom of occupation to the hope that Jews would give up peddling and money-lending for tilling the soil and handicrafts.',
		'History took a different course. Industrialization and the advance of capitalism meant that traditional livelihoods were in decline for all segments of society. Jews from trading backgrounds like the Simson brothers were well-poised to take advantage of opportunities in the emerging system. In the textile, food and beverage, publishing, and retail industries, Jews with roots in trade and commerce leveraged their small capital and connections to raw materials producers and consumers into major enterprises. Rudolf Mosse’s publishing house, Emil Rathenau’s “General Electrical Works (AEG)”, and Salman Schocken’s department stores were among the most prominent firms in the German economy.',
		'In the demilitarized Weimar republic, Simson &amp; Co. received the exclusive license to produce weapons for the Reichswehr. Although this contract allowed the business to weather the economic cataclysm of 1929, the company’s success was fodder for antisemitic propaganda against the “Jewish monopoly.” One local Nazi functionary named Fritz Sauckel made the company a target of a personal crusade. In 1927, he publishedan editorial in Der National-Sozialist claiming that Simson had billed the Reichswehr for costs related to its civilian products. He claimed, absurdly, that workers kept gun parts under their workbenches as they built bicycles, which they would swap out at short notice to deceive military inspectors.',
		'It was the first of a series of scurrilous claims that came to a head at the Gestapo headquarters on Prinz-Albrecht-Straße in Berlin on November 23, 1935. In the nerve center of the Nazi terror apparatus, Arthur Simson was forced to sign a contract transferring control of the company to Sauckel. As was the case for thousands of other businesses large and small, the “Sales Agreement” that transferred the company into “Aryan” hands included no compensation for the Jewish owners. The value of the company was offset by a penalty for “excess profits” allegedly skimmed off the Reichswehr orders. Stripped of their family’s business, Arthur and Julius Simson joined their siblings in the United States and began their long fight for restitution.',
		'The Simson company was stolen from its owners based on the idea that Jews in Germany had “disproportionate” economic influence that harmed ordinary workers. Notwithstanding the narrowness of a conception of “ordinary workers” that excludes Jews, there are many examples of extraordinary achievement by Jewish entrepreneurs during the period of Germany’s industrialization. And these firms created not just technical innovations and wealth, but material culture that lives on in recognizable brands from Nivea skincare products to Fromm’s condoms to the Simson Schwalbe.',
		'As the story of Moses and Löb Simson illustrates, the remarkable successes of some Jewish entrepreneurs (outliers like many stories of entrepreneurial success) was connected to some circumstances and historical processes specific to Jews, and some that were systemic economic transformations. The Jewish names and brands that are still found on German products today—from Nivea creme to Fromm’s Condoms to the Simson Schwalbe—are reminders of the deep connections between Jews and Germans throughout German history, but the stories are often forgotten. In fact, the thorny questions of ownership and restitution remain unresolved even today.',
